### Trading Strategies Research

Now I need to research automated trading strategies specifically for meme coins and pump.fun tokens.


### Trading Strategies Analysis

**Common Meme Coin Trading Strategies:**

**1. New Coin Sniping Strategy:**
- **Entry Timing**: Target tokens within first 5-10 minutes of launch
- **Profit Targets**: 25% first take profit, 50% second take profit
- **Stop Loss**: 10-15% maximum loss threshold
- **Position Sizing**: 0.015-0.05 SOL per trade for risk management
- **Bonding Curve Monitoring**: Exit at 15% bonding curve progress, keep 25% as "moon bag"

**2. Long-term Investment Strategy:**
- **Selection Criteria**: Tokens with strong community, developer activity, social media presence
- **Entry Points**: Market cap between 10K-100K for growth potential
- **Hold Duration**: 1-30 days depending on momentum
- **Profit Targets**: 100-1000% gains for long-term holds
- **Risk Management**: Diversify across multiple tokens, maximum 5% portfolio per token

**3. Copy Trading Strategy:**
- **Target Wallets**: Monitor successful traders and developers
- **Execution Speed**: Sub-second execution to match target trades
- **Position Scaling**: Proportional to target wallet size and success rate
- **Risk Controls**: Maximum copy amount limits, blacklist certain tokens

**4. Multi-Wallet Reputation Management:**
- **Wallet Separation**: Different wallets for sniping vs long-term holds
- **Reputation Building**: Maintain clean transaction history for long-term wallets
- **Risk Distribution**: Spread trades across multiple wallets to avoid detection
- **Wallet Rotation**: Cycle through wallets to maintain anonymity

**Key Risk Management Principles:**
- Never risk more than 2-5% of total capital per trade
- Use trailing stop losses to lock in profits
- Set maximum daily loss limits
- Implement circuit breakers for unusual market conditions
- Monitor for rug pulls and honeypot tokens
